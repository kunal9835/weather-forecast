## Overview
This system leverages real-time data processing to monitor weather conditions. It fetches data from OpenWeatherMap, processes it to produce summarized insights such as average temperature, humidity, and weather rollups over defined intervals. 

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Rollups and Aggregates**: Summarizes data over intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- **Weather Insights**: Displays key metrics like temperature trends, humidity, and precipitation.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with React for a responsive and interactive UI.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for frontend logic.
- **CSS**: Styling for responsive layout and component design.
